A Tiny SPICE Simulator
======================

Ionsamhl√≥ir ciorcaid an-bheag.

A teeny-weeny SPICE simulator implemented in Rust. It can read a (simple) SPICE
deck, perform the (limited) analyses listed in the `.control` section and write
some waveform data to a file.


Supported SPICE Deck Stuff
--------------------------
Currently supported components:
* `V` - voltage source, `DC` and `SIN()`
* `I` - current source, `DC` and `SIN()`
* `R` - resistor
* `C` - capacitor
* `D` - diode (basic)

Analyses supported:
* `op`    - DC operating point
* `trans` - Transient analysis

In SPICE decks:
* The 'first-line is a title' behaviour is supported
* Engineering notation is supported, e.g. `1k` is 1000
* A control block with a small list of commands between `.control` and `.endc` is
  supported


Unsupported Stuff
-----------------
A _huge_ list of things are _not_ supported. Everything not listed above, which
includes:
* DC Sweeps are not supported
* Sub-circuits are not supported
* MOSFETs and other transistors are not supported
* Noise Analysis is not supported
* Circuit topology checks are not supported
* Even simple commands such as `print` and `plot` are not supported


Running a Simulation
---------------------
The binary name of the teeny-weeny SPICE simulator in this repo is `tiny-spice-rs`.
Since it is written in Rust, so you'll need Cargo and all that to run simulations.

As an example, let's run a transient analysis on a full-wave rectifier. A sinewave
voltage source drives one pair of terminals of the diode bridge. The other pair
of diode bridge terminals has a capacitor and resistor in parallel as a load.

The circuit in `ngspice/fullwave_rectifier.spi` is this:

```spice
Full-Wave Rectifier

V1 1 2 SIN(0 5 1e3) ; input voltage
V2 2 0 0  ; ground, and current measure

* full-wave rectifier
D1 1 3
D2 4 1
D3 2 3
D4 4 2

* Small caps across the diodes to prevent time-step-too-small
CD1 1 3 12pF
CD2 4 1 12pF
CD3 2 3 12pF
CD4 4 2 12pF

* Load
Rl 3 4 1k
Cl 3 4 1uF

.control
*  option reltol = 0.001
*  option abstol = 1e-12

  tran 100ns 2ms 
  option ; ngspice only shows new values after analysis

  plot v(1,2) v(3,4) ; (ngspice)
.endc
```

Build the simulator, and run the simulation using the command below:

```bash
cargo run ngspice/fullwave_rectifier.spi
```

Waveforms will be stored in a file called `waves/fullwave_rectifier/tran.dat`.
Waveforms for all nodes in the design will be in this file. The file is in
TSV format (tab-separated values). The first row has the column names. The
second row has the units of eac column. All other rows contain waveform data
in floating-point format.

```TSV

```

To view the waveforms, load in a spreadsheet and chart some columns. For example, chart:
* the input voltage `v(1)-v(2)`
* the output voltage `v(3)-v(4)`

(If you have `python3` and `matplotlib` installed, try:

```bash
python3 bin/r8n -expr "2-3,4-5" waves/fullwave_rectifier
```
)
