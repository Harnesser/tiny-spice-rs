# Goals for `tiny-spice-rs`

## Next
* Implement subcircuits.

## Shorter Term
* Operational Amplifier Model
 (none)

## Longer Term
* DC Sweeps
* Dependent Sources?

## Far Future
* Reciprocity, (maybe needs something like noise anaylsis first?)


## Done
* Figure out what to do with `print` and `plot`
 - ignoring them for now
* Expand the allowed netnames to inculde ascii characters
 - can still use "integers" if you want
