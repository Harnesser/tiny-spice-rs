I think I want to get this supporting drum machine circuits:

* Inverter, somehow. - Nope, opamp model.
    - Implemented VCVS and VCCS
    - Next, opamp macromodel

!!!! My simulator can't handle the opamp !!!!


Have a .lib command that can read in a spice deck, but ignore the
toplevel instantiations and `.control` blocks. Only read the
subcircuit definitions? This would allow me to play with subckts
locally - it's kinda like allowing blocklevel tests.
